title: I took Lamotrigine (Lamitcal) for 6 months
---

<i>To keep this to the point, I won't provide a lot of background of my emotional or psychological history leading up to my use of Lamitcal. At a high level, I felt emotionally and mentally abysmal and was having trouble keeping myself from crying throughout the day. For several years (since 2020 when I was 21 years old) I had become used to a set of other psychopathological traits like graphic intrusive mental images and sounds, panic attacks, and compulsive picking behaviors, just to say a few, as well as ecstatic, magical states in which the world glittered and I felt powerful, but I had never experienced this persistent sadness and pain. My boyfriend suggested that all of these things didn't sound normal and might be treatable, which in a way was a new thought to me, so I saw a psychiatrist.</i>

In October of 2024, I was prescribed a low dose of Lamictal (100 mg/day with the normal ramp-up period starting at 25 mg) to treat mood fluctuations (depression and hypomania occurring within days of each other, sometimes within hours).
