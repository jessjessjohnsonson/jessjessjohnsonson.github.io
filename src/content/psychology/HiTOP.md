title: The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychology (HiTOP)
description: The HiTOP model is a still-developing taxonomy of mental disorders that prioritizes scientific evidence of mover convention and clinical opinion.

- "Rather than re-arranging DSM and ICD disorders, HiTOP aims to create a system based on signs and symptoms described in these manuals (as well as additional symptoms) and reorganize them based on how studies have found them to occur in combination."
- Dimensional (but open to evidence of discrete psychopathological categories), as dimensional formulations of psychological measures prove more reliable, eliminate unspecified or not-otherwise-defined diagnoses, and capture everybody, not just in- and out-groups.
- Assumes that the natural organization of psychopathological symptoms follows from their co-occurrence, so related symptoms are grouped together. This is said to capture information about underlying genetics, risk factors, biomarkers, and treatment response.
- Psychopathology can be organized hierarchically from narrow to broad categories, meaning patterns of comorbidity are captured by higher-order dimensions.
- Signs, symptoms, and maladaptive traits (pathological personality characteristics, e.g., submissiveness) and behaviors are grouped into homogeneous clusters called <i>syndroms</i>. Clusters of <i>syndromes</i> form <i>subfactors</i>, and larger constellations of <i>syndromes</i> form <i>spectra</i>. Six <i>spectra</i> have been identified so far:
1. Thought Disorder Spectrum - maladaptive traits of peculiarity, unusual beliefs, unusual experiences, and fantasy proneness, as well as symptom dimensions of disorganization and reality distortion; also symptom dimensions of dissociation and mania are linked to this spectrum provisionally. 
2. Detachment Spectrum - maladaptive traits of emotional detachment, anhedonia, social withdrawal, and romantic disinterest, as well as symptom dimensions of inexpressivity and avolition.
3. Antagonistic Externalizing Spectrum - maladaptive traits of manipulativeness, deceitfulness, callousness, grandiosity, aggression, rudeness, domineering, and suspiciousness, as well as symptom dimensions characteristic of antisocial behavior, such as theft, fraud, destruction of property, and aggression.
4. Disinhibited Externalizing Spectrum - maladaptive traits of impulsivity, irresponsibility, distractibility, disorganization, risk taking, (low) perfectionism, (low) workaholism, as well as symptom dimensions characteristic of antisocial behavior (listed above), substance use and abuse, inattention, and hyperactivity.
5. Internalizing Spectrum - maladaptive traits of emotional lability, anxiousness, separation insecurity, submissiveness, perseveration, and anhedonia, as well as symptom dimensions characteristic of distress, fear, eating problems, and sexual problems; also symptom dimensions of mania are linked to this spectrum provisionally.
6. Somatoform Spectrum - symptom dimensions of conversion, somatization, malaise, head pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and cognitive symptoms.

- <i>Superspectra</i> are broad dimensions comprising multiple spectra. Some identified <i>superspectra</i> are:
1. Exteranlizing Superspectrum - captures antagonistic externalizing and disinhibited spectra.
2. Emotional Dysfunction Superspectrum (proposed)
3. Psychosis Superspectrum (proposed)
