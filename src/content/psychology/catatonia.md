Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome involving too little (hypokinetic), too much (hyperkinetic), or abnormal (parakinetic) movement, defined in the DSM-5 by the presence of 3 or more of 12 psychomotor features:  
1. Stupor — no psychomotor activity, not actively relating to environment  
2. Catalepsy — holding an externally-induced posture against gravity  
3. Waxy flexibility — slight, even resistance to re-positioning  
4. Mutism — no or very little verbal response  
5. Negativism — opposition or no response to instructions or stimuli  
6. Posturing — spontaneously holding a strange posture against gravity  
7. Mannerism — odd, circumstantial caricature of normal actions  
8. Stereotypy — repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements  
9. Agitation not influenced by external stimuli  
10. Grimacing — holding strange positions of the face  
11. Echolalia — mimicking others' speech  
12. Echopraxia — mimicking others' movements

Any of the motoric substypes of catatonia (hypo-, hyper-, and parakinetic) can be accomompanied by "malignant" symptoms of the autonomic nervous system that can be fatal (e.g., high or low blood pressure)

## History
Over time, the number of symptoms used to define catatonia has expanded, though the number required to be fulfilled for diagnosis has also increased, showing how the field's understanding of catatonia has become subtler and included more nuanced signs of catatonia while the diagnostic process as a whole has grown more stringent to avoid pathologizing normal variations in people.

The DSM-III (1980) included catatonia only as a sub-type of schizophrenia (i.e., Schizophrenia, Catatonic Type). It describes the catatonic type to involve stupor, negativism, rigidity, excitement, or posturing, similar to modern definitions, with associated features like stereotypies, mannerisms, wavy flexibility, and mutism. Interestingly, the DSM-III notes that the catatonic schizophrenic type was "very common several decades ago" but "is not rare in Europe and North America". A patient with schizophrenia dominated by any 1 of these 5 symptoms fulfilled the catatonic type:  
- Catatonic stupor (marked decrease in reactivity to environment
and/or reduction of spontaneous movements and activity) or mutism  
- Catatonic negativism (an apparently motiveless resistance to all
instructions or attempts to be moved)  
- Catatonic rigidity (maintenance of a rigid posture against efforts
to be moved)  
- Catatonic excitement (excited motor activity, apparently purposeless and not influenced by external stimuli)  
- Catatonic posturing (voluntary assumption of inappropriate or
bizarre posture)

The DSM-IV (1994) retained the catatonia sub-type for schizophrenia with adjusted diagnostic criteria. At least 2 of the these 5 symptoms had to dominate the clinical picture of a person presenting with schizophrenia:  
- Motoric immobility as evidenced by catalepsy (including waxy flexibility) or stupor  
- Excessive motor activity (that is apparently purposeless and not influenced by external stimuli)  
- Extreme negativism (an apparently motiveless resistance to all instructions or maintenance of a rigid posture against attempts to be moved) or mutism  
- Peculiarities of voluntary movement as evidenced by posturing (voluntary assumption of inappropriate or bizarre postures), stereotyped movements, prominent mannerisms, or prominent grimacing  
- Echolalia or echopraxia  

The DSM-5 (2013), -TR (2022) and ICD-11 (2022) all now present catatonia as a unique syndrome that warrants independent recognition outside of its relationship to schizophrenia.
