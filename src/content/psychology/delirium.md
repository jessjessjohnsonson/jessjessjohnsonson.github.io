Delirium is a syndrome involving an acute disturbance in consciousness — characterized by reduced awareness of the environment and impairments in attention — resulting from intoxication or withdrawal from a substance or medication. It is defined in the DSM-5 by the following criteria:  
- A disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) accompanied by reduced awareness of the environment.  
- The disturbance develops over a short period of time (usually hours to a few days), represents a change from baseline attention and awareness, and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of the day.  
- An additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation, language, visuospatial ability, or perception).  
- The disturbances in 1-3 are not better explained by another preexisting, established, or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as coma.  
- There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medication condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple eiologies.  

Delirium can be acute (lasting a few hours or days) to persistent (lasting weeks or months), and can present as hyperactive, hypoactive, or with a mixed level of activity.
