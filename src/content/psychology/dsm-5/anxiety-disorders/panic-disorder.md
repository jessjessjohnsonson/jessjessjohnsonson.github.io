## DSM-5
1. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks, defined by an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches peak within minutes and during which four or more of the following symptoms occur:  
    1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate  
    2. Sweating  
    3. Trembling or shaking  
    4. Sensations of shortness of breath or being smothered  
    5. Feelings of choking  
    6. Chest pain or discomfort  
    7. Nausea or abdominal distress  
    8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint  
    9. Chills or heat sensations  
    10. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)  
    11. Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)  
    12. Fear of losing control or "going crazy"  
    13. Fear of dying  
2. At least one or the attacks has been followed by 1 month of one or more of the following:  
    1. Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).  
    2. A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).  
3. The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition.  
4. The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific phobia; in response to obsessions, as in  OCD; in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in PTSD; or in response to separation from attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).

### Differential Diagnosis
- Only limited-symptom panic attacks  
- Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition  
- Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder  
- Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e.g., other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders)
