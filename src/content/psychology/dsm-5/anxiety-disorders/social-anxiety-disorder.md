1. Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech).  
<i>Note, in children the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults.</i>  
2. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others).  
3. The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.  
<i>Note, fear and anxiety in children may present as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.</i>  
4. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.  
5. The fear or anxiety is out of propotion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context.  
6. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more.  
7. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occuptational functioning.  
8. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition.  
9. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder.  
10. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinsonâ€™s disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive.
