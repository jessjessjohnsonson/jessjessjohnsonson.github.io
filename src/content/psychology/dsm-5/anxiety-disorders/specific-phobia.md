Somes interesting facts from the DSM:  
- Approximately 75% of those with a specific phobia fear more than one situation or object.  
- Women are nearly doubly affected by specific phobias.  
- Specific phobia is associated with both suicidal thoughts and attempts, and is associated with a transition from ideation to attempt; a study in Germany found that 30% of first suicide attempts in individuals 14-24 could be attributed to specific phobia.  
- People with specific phobia are at increased risk for developing other disorders, such as anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substance-related disorders, somatic symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders, particularly dependent personality disorder.

## DSM-5
1. Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood).  
<i>Note, fear and anxiety in children may present as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.</i>  
2. The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety.  
3. The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.  
4. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context.  
5. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting 6 months or more.  
6. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes cinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.  
7. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia); objects or situations related to obsessions (as in OCD); reminders of traumatic events (as in PTSD); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder).
