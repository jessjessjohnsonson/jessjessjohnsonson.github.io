description: Panic attacks or anxiety brought on by exposure to or withdrawal from a substance or medication.
---

## DSM-5
1. Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture.  
2. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both:  
    1. The symptoms developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to or withdrawal from a medication.  
    2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms.  
3. The disturbance is not better explained by an anxiety disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder could include the following:  
The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent nonsubstance/medication-related episodes).  
4. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.  
5. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.  
<i>Note, this diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the anxiety symptoms predominate in the clinical picture and they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.</i>
