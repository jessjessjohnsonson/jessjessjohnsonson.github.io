Bipolar I disorder is characterized by recurrent mood episodes (i.e., manic, depressive, hypomanic). However, only one full manic episode is required for diagnosis because just one provides sufficient evidence of underlying bipolar I that will result in more manic and depressive episodes.  
Mood during a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or "feeling on top of the world". The person may strike up extensive conversations with strangers, or take up multiple, overlapping new projects with little knowledge on the topic. The increased energy may occur at unusual hours of the day, for example during the person's normal sleep hours.  
Inflated self-esteem is common, sometimes reaching delusional proportions or involving grandiose delusions (e.g., having a special relationship to a famous person).  
Decreased need for sleep is one of the most common features, which is different from insomnia in which the person wants to sleep but can't. People with bipolar I may sleep very little, if at all, or wake up hours earlier than usual, feeling rested and full of energy. Often decreased need for sleep indicates the onset of a manic episode.  
Rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to understand speech can also be present, marked by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality with dramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. The person may talk continuously, intrusively, and without concern for the relevance of what is said. If the person's mood is more irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or angry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the person.  
Thoughts often race in the person's head faster than can be expressed by speech, and frequently flooded with ideas. If the flood of ideas is severe, speech might become disorganized, incoherent, and distressing to the person.  
Increased sex drive and fantasies are common, as well as sociability (e.g., contacting old acquaintances or strangers). 

## DSM-5
1. At least one manic episode.  
    <br>
    <i>Manic Episode Criteria</i>  
    1. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently goal-directed behavior or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization was necessary)
    2. During the period of increased energy or activity, three or more of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), are present to a significant degree, and are noticeably different from usual behavior:  
        1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity  
        2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feeling rested after only 3 hours of sleep)  
        3. More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking  
        4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing  
        5. Distractibility (i.e., attention is too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli)  
        6. Increased goal-directed activity (socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation  
        7. Excessive involvement in pleasureable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indescretions, foolish business investments)  
    3. Symptoms are sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features.  
    4. The episode is not attributable to the direct physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.  
    <i>Note, a full manic episode that emerges during antidepressent treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect that treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and therefore a bipolar I diagnosis.</i>  
2. The manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, other or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

### Specifiers
- Current or most recent manic episode:  
    - Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
    - With psychotic features 
    - In partial remission  
    - In full remission
- Current or most recent hypomanic episode:  
    - Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
    - With psychotic features 
    - In partial remission  
    - In full remission
- Current or most recent major depression episode: 
    - Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
    - With psychotic features 
    - In partial remission  
    - In full remission
- Current or most recent episode, unspecified:  
    - Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
    - With psychotic features 
    - In partial remission  
    - In full remission
- With anxious distress  
- With mixed features  
- With rapid cycling  
- With melancholic features  
- With atypical features (e.g., mood brightens in response to positive events, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis, long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity)  
- With mood-congruent psychotic features (i.e., the content of delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc.)  
- With mood-incongruent psychotic features (i.e., the content of delusions and hallucinations does not involve the manic themes of grandiosity, invulnerability, etc. or is mixed)  
- with catatonia 
- With peripartum onset  
- With seasonal pattern
- Remission status if full criteria are not currently met for a manic, hypomanic, or major depressive episode.

### Differential Diagnosis
- MDD  
<i>Note, the first episode of bipolar disorder is often depressive and depressive symptoms are the most frequent symptoms across the long-term course of bipolar disorder. Also, depression is typically the symptom for which the person seeks help.</i>
- Bipolar II disorder  
- Cyclothymic disorder  
- Other specific bipolar and related disorder  
- Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition  
- Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder
- GAD  
<i>Note, anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts and efforts to minimize anxious feelings may be mistaken for impulsive behavior.</i>
- Panic disorder  
- PTSD  
- Other anxiety disorders
- Schizoaffective disorder  
<i>Note, "bipolar I disorder, with psychotic features" is diagnosed if the psychotic symptoms have occurred exclusively during manic or major depressive episodes.</i> 
- ADHD  
<i>Note, ADHD symptoms that mimic manic episodes (e.g., increased activity, impulsive behavior, distractibility) have their onset before age 12, whereas mania in bipolar I occur in distinct episodes and typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood.</i>  
- Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder  
- Personality disorders (e.g., BPD)
