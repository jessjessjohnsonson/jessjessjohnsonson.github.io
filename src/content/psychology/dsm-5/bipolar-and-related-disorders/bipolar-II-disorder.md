title: Bipolar II Disorder
description: Recurrent hypomanic episodes, typically alternating with major depressive episodes over time.
---

The DSM-5 no longer considers bipolar II to be a less severe diagnosis than bipolar I, insofar as the burden of depression and unstable moods in bipolar II often incur serious impairments in social and work life.

## DSM-5
1. One or more hypomanic episode(s) and one or more major depressive episode(s) as specified by:  
    <br>
    <i>Hypomanic Episode</i>  
    1. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.  
    2. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three or more of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:  
        1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.  
        2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feeling rested after only 3 hours of sleep).  
        3. More talkative than usual or pressured to keep talking.  
        4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.  
        5. Distractibility (i.e., attention is too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli) as reported or observed.  
        6. Increased goal-directed activity (socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation.  
        7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indescretions, foolish business investments).  
    3. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.  
    4. The symptoms and change in functioning are observable by others.  
    5. The episode is not severe enough to cause marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or necessitate hospitalization.  
    <i>Note, if there are psychotic features, the episode is manic by definition.</i>  
    6. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.
    <br>
    <i>Major Depressive Episode</i>  
    1. Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning (at least one symptom must be depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure):  
        1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, indicated by subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation by others (e.g., appears tearful).  
        <i>Note, in children and adolescents this can be irritable mood.</i>  
        2. Loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities most of the day, nearly every day (indicated by subjective report or observation by others).  
        3. Significant unintentional weight loss/gain (e.g., more than 5% of body weight in a month) or descrease/increase in appetite nearly every day.  
        <i>Note, in children, failure to make expected weight gains.</i>  
        4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.  
        5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day severe enough to be observable by others.  
        6. Fatigue or low energy neary every day.  
        7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive, inappropriate, or delusional guilt (i.e., not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).  
        8. Impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions nearly every day as indicated by subjective report or observation by others.  
        9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, a specific plan for committing suicide or one or more suicide attempts.  
    2. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.  
    3. The symptoms cannot be accounted for by substance use or a medical condition.  
2. There has never been a full manic episode.  
3. The hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.  
4. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.
