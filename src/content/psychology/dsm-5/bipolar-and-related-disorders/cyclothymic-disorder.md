### Specifiers

### Differential Diagnosis
- Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling 
- Bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling  
- Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition  
- Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder  
- Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder  
- BPD  
<i>Note, mood lability in BPD is distinctly unstable, changing from anger to sadness to anxiety within the span of minutes, whereas the cyclothymic changes in mood have a more stable quality even though they can cycle between hypomania to depression within one day.</i>
