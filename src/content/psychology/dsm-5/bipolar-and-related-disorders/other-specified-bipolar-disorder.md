---

This diagnosis is given when characteristic bipolar symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning, but do not meet the full criteria for any more specific bipolar disorder. The "other specified" category is used when clinicians choose to communicate the specific reason that the the criteria are not met, such as:  
- Short-duration hypomanic episodes (2-3 days) and major depressive episodes.  
- Hypomanic episodes with insufficient symptoms and major depressive episodes. 
- Hypomanic episode without prior major depressive episode.  
- Short-duration cyclothymia (less than 2 years).  
- Manic episode superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
