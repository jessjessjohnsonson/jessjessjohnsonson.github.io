title: Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder
description: Bipolar symptoms without a specific reason for not meeting criteria for other bipolar diagnoses.
---

This diagnosis is given when characteristic bipolar symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning, but do not meet the full criteria for any more specific bipolar disorder. The "unspecified" category is used when clinicians choose not to communicate the specific reason that the the criteria are not met, including presentiations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., emergency rooms).
