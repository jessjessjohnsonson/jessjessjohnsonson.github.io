---

## DSM-5
1. A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.  
2. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition.  
3. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in
which the stressor is a serious medical condition).  
4. The symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of delirium.  
5. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.  

### Specifiers
- With depressive features (i.e., full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met)  
- With major depressive-like episode (i.e., full criteria except Criterion 3 are met for a major depressive episode)  
- With mixed features (symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but do not dominate the clinical picture)  

### Differential Diagnosis
- Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition  
- Delirium and major or mild neurocognitive disorder  
- Adjustment disorders  
- Demoralization  
<i>Note, Demoralization typically lacks the anhedonia associated with depressive disorder due to another medical condition, and individuals will generally find pleasure in previously meaningful activities and be able to experience moments of happiness.</i>
