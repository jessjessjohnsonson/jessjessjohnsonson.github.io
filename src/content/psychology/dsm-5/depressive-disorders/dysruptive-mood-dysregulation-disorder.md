title: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder
description: Chronic severe irritability in children lasting over one year.
acronyms: DMDD
---

This diagnosis was added to the DSM-5 to address concerns about the overdiagnosis of bipolar disorder in children. Rates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low, and children diagnosed with DMDD are more at risk of developing unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. 

## Diagnostic Critiera
1. Severe recurrent temper outbursts (verbal or physical aggression) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity and duration to the situation or provocation.  
2. The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.  
3. The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per week.  
4. The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others.  
5. The symptoms above have been present for 12 or more months; throughout that period, there has not been a period of 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms above.  
6. The symptoms are present in at least 2 of 3 settings — at home, at school, with peers — and are severe in at least 1 of these.  
7. The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 or after age 18.  
8. By history or observation, the age of onset is before 10 years.  
9. There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day during which the full symptoms criteria (except duration) for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met.  
10. The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of MDD and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., ASD, PTSD, separation anxiety disorder).  
<i>Note, this diagnosis cannot coexist with ODD, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder, but it can exist with others like MDD, ADHD, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. If the person has ever met the criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis DMDD should not be assigned. If the person fulfills criteria for ODD, the diagnosis should only be DMDD.</i>  
11. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical or neurological condition.  

### Differential Diagnosis
- Bipolar disorders  
<i>Note, bipolar disorders manifest in children, as they do in adults, in discrete episodes of mood perturbation, whereas in DMDD the irritable mood is persistent over many months.</i>  
- ODD  
<i>Note, while the symptoms of ODD and DMDD are quite similar, the persistent mood symptoms of DMDD are rare in children with ODD.</i>  
- ADHD  
- MDD  
- Anxiety disorders  
- ASD  
- Intermittent explosive disorder
