1. Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning. At least one of the symptoms is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.  
    1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation by others (e.g., appears tearful).  
    <i>Note, in children and adolescents, this can be irritable mood.</i>  
    2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day.  
    3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain.  
    4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.  
    5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day that is observable to others.  
    6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.  
    7. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt nearly every day.  
    8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day.  
    9. Recurrent thoughts about death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicide.  
2. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning.  
3. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition.  
4. At least one major depressive episode is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder and is not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.  
5. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.  
<i>This exclusion does not apply if any manic- or hypomanic-like episodes were substance-induced or attributable to the effects of another medical condition.</i>
