This diagnosis is given when characteristic symptoms of a depressive disorder cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning and predominate the clinical picture, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders class and do not meet criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The "other" specified depressive disorder category is used when the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive disorder. Some examples include:  
- Recurrent brief depression â€” depressed mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2-13 days at least once per month (not associated with menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months.  
- Short-duration depressive episode (4-13 days)  
- Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms  
- Major depressive episode superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
