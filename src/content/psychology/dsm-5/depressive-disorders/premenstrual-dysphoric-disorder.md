<i>Note, these should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles.</i>
    1. One or more of the following must be present of the five (when combined with those listed in (b)):

        2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.  
        3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts.

        2. Subjective difficulty in concentration  
        3. Lethargy, easy fatiguability, or marked lack of energy

        6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control  
        7. Physical symptoms — breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of bloating or weight gain.
