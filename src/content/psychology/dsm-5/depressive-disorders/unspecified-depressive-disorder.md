title: Unpecified Depressive Disorder
description: Depressed mood or lack of interest or pleasure that dominate the clinical picture but do not meet full criteria for an unspecified reason.
---

This diagnosis is given when characteristic symptoms of a depressive disorder cause clinically
significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning and predominate the clinical picture, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders class and do not meet criteria for adjustment disorder with depressed mood or adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. The "unspecified" depressive disorder category is used when the clinician chooses not to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive disorder, or when there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., emergency rooms).
