        6. Avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort.

        8. Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.  
        9. Is forgetful in daily activities.  
    <i>Hyperactivity-Impulsivity</i>

        2. Leaves their seat in situations when reminaing seated is expected.  
        3. Runs about or climbs in situations where those behaviors are inappropriate.  
        4. Is unable to play or take part in leisure activities quietly.  
        5. Is "on the go" or acting as if "driven by a motor" (i.e., is uncomfortable or unable to be still for extended time).

2. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms were present before the age of 12.  
3. Several inattentive or hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present in two or more settings (e.g., at home, school or work, with friends or relatives).  
4. Symptoms clearly interfere with, or reduce the quality of, social, academic, or occupational functioning.  
5. Symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., mood disorder, anxiety disorder, dissassociative disorder, personaltiy disorder, substance intoxication or withdrawal).  

### Specifiers
ADHD can also be diagnosed as Other Specific or Unspecified.

- Combined presentation — If enough symptoms of both Inattention and Hyperativity-Impulsivity criteria were present for the past 6 months.  
- Predominantly inattentive presentation — If 6 or more symptoms of Inattention are present, but not Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months.  
- Predominantly hyperative-impulsive presentation — If enough symptoms of Hyperactivity-Impulsivity, but not Impulsivity, were present for the past 6 months.  
- In partial remission — When full criteria were previously met, fewer than the full criteria have been met for the past 6 months, and the symptoms still result in impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.  
- Severity:
    - Mild — Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and symptoms result in no more than minor impairments in social, academic, or occupational functioning.  
    - Moderate — Symptoms or functional impairment between "Mild" and "Severe" are present.  
    - Severe — Many symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis, or several symptoms that are particularly severe, are present, or the symptoms result in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning.
