## DSM-5
1. Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by the following:  
    1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity, ranging (e.g., failure to engage in normal back-and-forth conversation, failure to initiate or respond to social interations, reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect)  
    2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction (e.g., abnormal eye contact and body language, deficits in understanding and using gestures, lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication)  
    3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships (e.g., difficulties adjusting behavior to suit different social contexts, difficulties in imaginitive play, difficulties making fields, absense of interest in peers)
2. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior and interests, as manifested by the following:  
    1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).  
    2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns or verbal nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day).  
    3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interest).  
    4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
3. Symptoms were present in the early developmental period (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed the person's capacity or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).  
4. Symptoms cause significant impairment in socail, academic, or occupational functioning.  
5. Symptoms are not better explained by ID or GDD.
