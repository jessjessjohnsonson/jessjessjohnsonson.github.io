## DSM-5
1. Disturbances in the fluency and time patterning of speech that are a) inappropriate to the person's age and language skills, b) persistent over time, and show frequent occurrences of one of the following:  
    1. Sound and syllable repititions  
    2. Sound prolongations  
    3. Broken words (pauses within words)  
    4. Audible or silent blocking (pauses filled by sound or silence)  
    5. Circumlocutions (avoiding certain words)  
    6. Words produced with excess physical tension  
    7. Monosyllabic whole-word repititions  
2. Anxiety about speaking that limits social, academic, or occupational participation.  
3. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (typically before age 8).  
4. The disturbance is not attributable to a speech-motor or sensory deficit, disfluency associated with neurological insult (e.g. - stroke, tumour, trauma), or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder.  

### Differential Diagnosis
- Sensory deficits  
- Normal speech dysfluencies  
- SLD, with impairment in reading  
- Bilingualism  
- Medication side effects  
- Adult-onset dysfluencies  
- Tourette's disorder

## Treatment

- Speech therapies to help slow down speech (e.g., fluency shaping therapy, stuttering modification therapy, electronic fluency devices)
- Stuttering-specific emotional therapies to help manage fear and shame (e.g., ARTS)
- CBT can be used to identify thought processes that contribute to stuttering and practice coping strategies for stress

### Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering (ARTS)
> "Every stutterer becomes in time a 'walking museum,' or perhaps a 'talking museum,' of those crutches, devices or mannerisms he has employed to conceal his stuttering." â€“ Joseph Sheehan

ARTS was based on Conflict Theory and Role Theory, as well as the Williams Normal Talking Model.  
Conflict Theory posits that if people are in conflict internally over their goals (to speak and to avoid stuttering), they will suffer doubt and confusion and perform less effectively. Avoidance reduction (approaching the fear) is thought to reduce that conflict.  
Role Theory states that if a person identifies as a role (a person who does not, or should not, stutter) and it leads to "playing the role" or acting disingenuously (pausing before speaking, pretending to think, pretending to not know the answer to a question) or the role is undermined (by stuttering), they will suffer shame. Acceptance of one's genuine role (a person who sometimes stutters) resolves the disconnect between internal self-concept and external actions, and improves self-esteem.  
Without fully explicating the model, I wanted to note two aspects I found interesting:  
- Most of the time, a person who stutters speaks fluently. The Normal Talking Model assumes that when they speak fluently, they are <i>doing</i> things right, and when they stutter they must be <i>doing</i> something, at some level, that causes the stutter. Additionally, the model assumes that the person can change or control those things to reduce their stuttering.  
- The model states that the person who stutters should become the world's foremost expert in their personal patterns of speech.  

ARTS therapy involves self-monitoring for learned escape behaviors that the individual has developed over time to avoid stuttering (but that ultimately limit the person's ability to participate in social and occupational life). Instead of repeating escape behaviors, the person is asked to do the very thing they have tried to hard to avoid: stutter. This "open stuttering" is a major milestone in ARTS. The goal is not to eliminate feelings of shame, but rather experience them and still count the practice as a success.  
The purpose of open stuttering is ultimately to practice gradual desensitization of the negative feeling reactions stirred up by moments of stuttering. Therapies like CBT and ACT help to reframe the perspective of these feelings and encourage acceptance. The true goal of ARTS is not to eliminate stuttering completely, but is rather about increasing joy and spontaneity in comminication as much as possible.
