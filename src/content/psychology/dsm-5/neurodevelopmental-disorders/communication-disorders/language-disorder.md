## DSM-5
1. Persistent difficulty in understanding or using language across modalities (written, spoken, signed, other) that lead to impairments in the following:  
  1. Size of vocabulary  
  2. Ability to form sentences  
  3. Ability to discuss a topic or have a conversation  
2. Language abilities are substantially and quantifiably below those expected for age, resulting in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, or occupational performance, individually or in any combination.  
3. The nset of symptoms is in the early developmental period.  
4. The difficulties are not attributable to hearing or other sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, or another medical or neurological condition and are not better explained by ID or GDD.

DLD overlaps with several other conditions that need to be differentiated at the time of diagnosis, including ASD, ID, hearing impairments, neurological disorders like epilepsy or aphasia, as well as normal variations in language acquisition among children.

### Differential Diagnosis

- Hearing or other sensory impairment  
- ID/IDD
