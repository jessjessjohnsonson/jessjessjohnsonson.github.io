title: Intellectual Disability
description: Deficits in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior that begin during the developmental period.
prevalence: 1-3%
acronyms: ID, IDD
synonyms: Intellectual Developmental Disorder
---
ID affects about 2-3% of the population, 25% of cases being related to a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome). Other common causes are prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures or deficiencies (e.g., prenatal alcohol, postnatal lead, prenatal iodine deficiency), and environmental causes (e.g., certain infections, brain injury). However, many cases (~30%) are of unknown cause.   

Signs and symptoms of ID include:
- Delays in reaching, or failure to reach milestones in motor skills development (e.g., sitting, crawling, walking)
- Delays in learning to speak, or continued difficulties with speech and language after starting to talk
- Difficulty with self-care (e.g., getting dressed, washing, feeding)
- Difficulty planning and/or problem-solving
- Behavioral and/or social problems
- Continued infant childlike behavior, failure to grow intellectually
- Difficulty keeping up in school
- Difficulty understanding and/or following social rules   

## DSM-5
1. Deficits in intellectual functioning (i.e., reasoning, planning, problem solving, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience) confirmed by clinical evaluation and IQ testing.  
2. Deficits in adaptive (real life) functioning (e.g., understanding rules, navigating daily living tasks, participating in family, school, and community activities) that significantly hamper the child's ability to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for the independence and social responsibility.  
3. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (typically before age 8).   

### Specifiers
- Severity:  
    - Mild (~75-90% of cases) — Often does not present until school age or even the second decade of life, when academic deficiencies become apparent, and does not require extensive support.  
    - Moderate (~10% of cases) — Marked differences from peers in conceptual skill attainment (e.g., writing, mathematics, time, money) and social/communicative behavior. The person can care for themselves but may need extended teaching or reminders on eating, dressing, elimination, and hygiene.   
    - Severe (~3.5% of cases) — Requires support with all daily living tasks, including meals, dressing bathing, and elimination. They may speak in single words or phrases and understand simple speech and gestures. Concept skills are limited, and the person generally has little understanding of written language, numbers, quantity, time, and money.    
    - Profound (~1.5% of cases) — The individual is dependent on others for all aspects of daily physical care, health, and safety. There is a very limited understanding of symbolic communication in speech or gesture and people with profound ID usually express their desires and emotions by nonverbal, nonsymbolic communication, though the person may understand some simple instructions or gestures.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Major and mild neurocognitive disorders  
- Communication disorders and SLD  
- ASD

## Relationship to Autism
About 30% of people with ASD are also diagnosed with ID. Although the two diagnoses share many characteristics, it is important to distinguish between them to prescribe the best treatment. People with ASD tend to have more trouble with non-verbal social behavior and cues, such as body language, and tend to isolate themselves more and make less eye contact, while people with ID show less repetitive and/or ritualistic behaviors. The top differentiating subsets have been found to be:
- Impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity
- Restricted interests
- Strict adherence to routines
- Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms
- Preoccupation with parts of objects.  

## Relationship to Epilepsy
About 22% of people with ID have epilepsy, which is associated with the severity level of the ID such that about 50% of people with profound ID experience epilepsy.
