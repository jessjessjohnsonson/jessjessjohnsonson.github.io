## DSM-5
1. Repetitive, seemingly driven, purposeless movements, such as hand shaking/waving, body rocking, head banging, self biting, or hitting one's own body.  
2. The repetitive motor behaviour interferes with social, academic, or other activities and may result in self-injury.  
3. Onset is in the early developmental period.  
4. The repetitive motor behaviour is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or neurological condition and is not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder (e.g., trichotillomania, obsessive-compulsive disorder).  

### Specifiers
- With or without self-injurious behavior (or behavior that would result in injury if not prevented)  
- Associated with a known medical or genetic condition, neurodevelopmental disorder, or environmental factor (e.g., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, intellectual disability, intrauterine alcohol exposure).  
- Severity:  
    - Mild —  Stereotypies are present but do not significantly impair functioning or cause self-harm.  
    - Moderate — Stereotypies cause some impairment in daily activities and social interactions or may lead to mild self-harm.   
    - Severe — Stereotypies cause significant impairment in daily activities, social interactions, or result in frequent or severe self-injurious behavior.  
- With self-injurious behavior, such as head banging or self-biting.  
- With associated medical or genetic condition.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Normal development  
- ASD  
- Tic disorders  
- OCD  
- Other neurological and medical conditions  
- Substance-induced repetitive behaviors  
- Functional (conversion) stereotypies

## Stereotypy vs. Tics
Stereotyped movements are common in infants and young children. They are distinct from tics in that stereotypy onsets earlier, around 1 to 3 years of age, while tics onset later, usually around 7 to 8. Tics are egodystonic; they wax and wane and diminish with age as proberty onsets, although they often get worse before they get better. Stereotypies do not change form and are egosyntonic.
