## DSM-5
1. Either a motor tic or vocal tic, but not both.  
2. The tic has persisted for at least one year since onset, though it may wax and wane in frequency.  
3. Onset is before 18 years of age.  
4. The tics are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington's disease, postviral encephalitis).  
5. The patient is not diagnosed with Tourette's Disorder.

Note, Persistent Tic Disorder is a distinct diagnosis from Tourette's Disorder because the multiple, multifacted tics present with Tourette's indicate a more complex underlying neurological condition with different treatment paths and comorbidity risks than a single persistent tic.
