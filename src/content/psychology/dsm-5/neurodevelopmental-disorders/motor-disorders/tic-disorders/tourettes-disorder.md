## DSM-5
1. Multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics have been present at some time, though not necessarily simultaneously.  
2. The tics have persisted for at least one year since onset, though they may wax and wane in frequency.  
3. Onset is before 18 years of age.  
4. The tics are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or another medical condition (e.g., Huntington's disease, postviral encephalitis).
