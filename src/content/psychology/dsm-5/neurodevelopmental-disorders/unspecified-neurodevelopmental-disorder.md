description: Symptoms of a neurodevelopmental disorder that do not meet full criteria for a more specific disorder.

This diagnosis is given when symptoms of a neurodevelopmental disorder are present but do not fulfill the criteria for a more specific diagnosis and the clinician chooses not to specify the reason why, which includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency rooms).
