## DSM-5
1. Presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both, as defined by:  
<i>Obsessions</i>  
    1. Recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are experienced, at some time during the disturbance, as intrusive and unwanted, and that in most individuals cause marked anxiety or distress.  
    2. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts, urges, or images, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., by performing a compulsion).  
<i>Compulsions</i>  
    1. Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, ordering, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.  
    2. The behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety or distress, or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these behaviors or mental acts are not connected in a realistic way with what they are designed to neutralize or prevent, or are clearly excessive.  
    <i>Note, young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these behaviors or mental acts.</i>  
2. The obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (e.g., take more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.  
3. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms are not attributable to the effects of a substance or another medication condition.  
4. The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., excessive worries, as in GAD; preoccupation with appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder; difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, as in hoarding disorder; hair pulling, as in trichotillomania [hair-pulling disorder]; skin picking, as in excoriation [skin-picking] disorder; stereotypies, as in stereotypic movement disorder; ritualized eating behavior, as in eating disorders; preoccupation with substances or gambling, as in substance-related and addictive disorders;
preoccupation with having an illness, as in illness anxiety disorder; sexual urges or fantasies, as in paraphilic disorders; impulses, as in disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders; guilty ruminations, as in MDD; thought insertion or delusional preoccupations, as in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; or repetitive patterns of behavior, as in ASD).  

### Specifiers
- With good or fair insight — the individual recognizes that OCD beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true.  
- With poor insight — The individual thinks OCD beliefs are probably true.  
- With absent insight/delusional beliefs — The individual is completely convinced that OCD beliefs are true.  
= Tic-related

### Differential Diagnosis
- Anxiety disorders  
- MDD  
<i>Note, ruminative thoughts in MDD are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily experienced as intrusive or distressing, and are not linked to compulsions.</i>  
- Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders  
- Eating disorders  
- Tics and stereotyped movements  
- Psychotic disorders  
- Other compulsive-like behaviors (e.g., compulsive sexual behavior in paraphilias, gambling disorder, substance use disorders)  
- OCPD  
<i>OCPD is not characterized by intrusive thoughts, images, urges, or repetitive behaviors. Instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. Both diagnoses can be given to a person who manifests both sets of symptoms.</i>

## DSM-IV (1994)
In the DSM-IV, OCD was listed under Anxiety Disorders with the same name and these diagnostic criteria:
