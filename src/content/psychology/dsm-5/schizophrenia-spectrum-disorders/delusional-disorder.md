1. One or more delusions lasting 1 month or longer.  
2. Schizophrenia Criterion A has never been met.  
<i>Note, hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusion theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation).</i>  
3. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired and behavior is not obviously odd or bizarre.  
4. If mood episodes have occurred concurrently with delusions, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.  
5. Symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as Body Dysmorphic Disorder or OCD.

### Specifiers
- Erotomanic type — The central theme of the delusion is that another person is in love with the individual.  
- Grandiose type — The central theme of the delusion is the conviction of having some great (but unrecognized) talent or insight or having made some important discovery.  
- Jealous type — The central theme of the delusion is that their spouse or lover is unfaithful.  
- Persecutory type — The central theme of the delusion involves the individual's belief that they are being conspired against, cheated, spied upon, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals.  
- Somatic type — The central theme of the delusion involves bodily functions or sensations.  
- Mixed type — Applies when there are multiple themes to the delusion(s) and no one predominates.  
- Unspecified type — Applies when the dominant delusional belief cannot be clearly determined or is not described by any one specific subtype.  
- With bizarre content — Delusions are deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from ordinary life experiences. For example, a belief that a stranger has removed their internal organs and replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any wounds or scars.
