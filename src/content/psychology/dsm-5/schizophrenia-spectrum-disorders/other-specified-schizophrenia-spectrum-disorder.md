This diagnosis is given when there are characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorer that cause significant distress or impairment in social or occupational functioning, but the person does not fit the full criteria for any of the disorders in the class or there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., emergency rooms). The "other" diagnosis is used when clinicians choose to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet other diagnosis criteria (e.g., persistent auditory hallucinations).
