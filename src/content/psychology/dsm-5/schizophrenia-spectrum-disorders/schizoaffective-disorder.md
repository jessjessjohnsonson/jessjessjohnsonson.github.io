Schizoaffective Disorder is the condition of concurrent Schizophrenia and Mood Disorder symptoms, and distinguishes patients as neither (a) Schizophrenic with mood symptoms, nor (b) having a mood disorder with psychotic features.

## DSM-5

2. <i>Psychotic-only Period</i> — During the same period of illness, there have been delusions or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms.  
3. <i>Mood Symptom Prominence</i> — Symptoms that meet criteria for a mood episode are present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
