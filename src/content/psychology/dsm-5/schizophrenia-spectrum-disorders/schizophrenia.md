Schizophrenia spectrum symptoms occur over three longitudinal stages:  
- Prodromal Phase — Subtle changes and gradual onset of social withdrawal, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences, while maintaining work and relationships, though with declining quality. This phase can last months to years.  
- Active (Acute) Phase — Positive symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech) are clearly present and cause severe functional impairment such that the person cannot work or maintain relationships. This phase can last weeks to months.  
- Residual Phase — Negative symptoms (e.g., flat affect, avolition) are more prominent with attenuated positive symptoms. Functional impairment is improved from the Active phase but remains below baseline. This phase can be ongoing, end, or cycle back to the Active phase.


## DSM-5
1. Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one must be (a) (b) or (c):    
    1. Delusions  
    2. Hallucinations  
    3. Disorganized speech (e.g., derailment or incoherence)  
    4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior  
    5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolution)  
    <i> Note, only one symptom is required if delusions are sufficiently bizarre or hallucinations consist of a voice keeping a running commentary on the person's behavior or thoughts, or two or more voices conversing with each other.</i> . 
2. <i>Social/Occupational Dysfunction </i>— For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational achievement).  
3. <i>Duration</i> — Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).  
4. <i>Schizoaffective and Mood Disorder Exclusion</i> — Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods.  
5. <i> Substance/General Medical Condition Exclusion </i> — The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.  
6. <i> Relationship to a Pervasive Developmental Disorder </i>— If there is a history of autistic disorder or another pervasive developmental disorder, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present for at least a month (or less if successfully treated).

### Specifiers
- First episode, currently in acute episode  
- First episode, currently in partial remission  
- First episode, currently in full remission  
- Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode  
- Multiple episodes, currently in partial remission  
- Multiple episodes, currently in full remission  
- Continuous  
- Unspecified
- With catatonia  
- Severity of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms:  
    - 0 — Absent 
    - 1 — Equivocal (e.g., odd or unusual beliefs that are not held with full conviction, fleeting or vague hallucinatory perceptual experiences that are not fully formed or distressing, occasional difficulty staying on topic or a slight loosening of associations, occasional or subtle unusual movements or mannerisms that are not overly bizarre or disruptive)  
    - 2 — Mild (e.g., fixed, false beliefs but not highly elaborate, infrequent, non-distressing hallucinations, speech is sometimes difficult to follow due to derailment or incoherence, brief catatonic features, noticeable decrease in facial expressivity or vocal prosody, reduced motivation or social withdrawal while maintaining basic care)  
    - 3 — Moderate (clear, well-formed delusions that influence their behavior, frequent, distressing hallucinations that influence their behavior, often difficult to follow due to significant derailment, tangentiality, or incoherence, prominent catatonic features, clear and consistent decrease in emotional expression and marked social withdrawal)  
    - 4 — Severe (e.g., delusions are pervasive, highly elaborate, and significantly dictate their behavior, severe and persistent hallucinations that are highly distressing and profoundly influence their actions, speech is almost impossible to follow, characterized by word salad or mutism, prolongued and extreme catatonic features, complete absense of emotional expression, profound avolition, and severe social isolation)
