description: Psychotic symptoms caused by the use of or withdrawal from substances or medications. 
---

## DSM-5
1. One or both of the following symptoms:  
    1. Delusions  
    2. Hallucinations  
2. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that either:  
    1. The symptom(s) developed during or within a month of substance intoxication or withdrawal, or  
    2. Medication used is eiologically related to the symptoms  
3. Symptoms are not better accounted for by a psychotic disorder that is not substance-induced. For example, the symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about a month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication, or are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the substance used or the duration of use; there is other evidence that suggests the existence of an independent nonsubstance-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent nonsubstance-related episodes).  
4. Symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of delirium.  
5. Symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 

### Specifiers
- With onset during intoxication  
- With onset during withdrawal  
- With onset after medication use  
- Severity (0-4)  

The ICD-10 includes specifiers for various substances (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, phencyclidine, cocaine, and several others) along with mild, moderate or severe, and without use indicators.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal (if reality testing remains intact and the person recognizes the perception changes are substance/medication-induced)  
- Independent psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder)  
- Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (i.e., symptoms are due to a medical condition itself and not associated medications)  
- Other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder
