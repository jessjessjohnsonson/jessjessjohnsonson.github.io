// Good diagnosis can be extremely important to a patient's wellbeing and life. What makes for a "good" diagnosis? 

// Notes: Allen Francis on the Psychiatry Bootcamp podcast (Ep 1.1) on writing an introduction to the DSM-IV to caution against  overdiagnosis, avoid over medication and polypharmacy/
// “A good diagnosis is a wonderful day in the patient’s life, an accurate diagnosis can be the best day in the patient’s life. The previously confusing, disturbing, misunderstood symptoms take shape… we understand this problem, we have a lot of experience with it and we have treatments for it. 
// An inaccurate diagnosis carries all the stigma, all the risks of overtreatment without any of the benefit.”

// “Diagnoses should all be written in pencil, they’re all hypotheses (especially in kids and the elderly)

// “We have 600,000 people with psychiatric illness in prison or homeless on the streets. We’re overdiagnosing the mildly ill and the worried well and we’re shamefully neglecting the people that most need our help.. so the system is too expansive on the mild end and not nearly enough focus on the severe end”

// On the important of “following the patient” and never treating any session as just routine:

// “People change because of corrective emotional experiences. It’s never just an insight, its never just a behavior, it’s never just a changed emotion, it’s a combination of all of these. It’s finding in life or in the session, in the contact with the therapist a way of seeing the world differently… and we have to be there to try to help them have that experience. that requires a high degree of attention, putting aside theoretical models, thinking through where this patient is in their life and what can I do to say something, to do something, that will materially get them to see things differently”

// We need to know the toolbox so well that we can set it aside in the session and be present with the patient

// - of the 30-40B spent by the NIH since the 80’s on neuroimaging and genetic testing and other studies aimed at finding the biological underpinning to psychiatric disorders, none replicate (check the validity of “none”) 
// - of the ~30M spent on clinical (psychotherapeutic) studies, we got DBT, CBT, etc. that have helped millions and millions of patients. 
// - 90%+ of the NIH budget is biological science, not clinical. “We’ve developed a brain institute that doesn’t focus on patients”
