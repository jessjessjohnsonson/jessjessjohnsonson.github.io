Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder (SPCD), also called semantic pragmatic disorder, is currently thought to be rooted in deficits in information processing as opposed to the use of language. The condition impairs a person's ability to grasp the central meaning or saliency of events, leading to a preference for routine things in which new relevance does not have to be deduced. SPCD was classified as distinct from Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the DSM-5 to distinguish the individuals who experience developmental delays and persistent impairments with social communication without the restrictive and repetitive behaviors associated with ASD. People with SPCD often develop eccentric interests but are not as obsessive as those with ASD.  

Symptoms of SPCD include:  
- Delayed language development  
- Word search pauses, jargoning, word order errors, word category errors, verb conjugation errors, and other language difficulties  
- Stuttering or cluttered speech  
- Repeating words or phrases  
- Tendency to be literal, concrete, and prefer facts to stories  
- Impaired reading comprehension  
- Following conversations (one-sided or off-topic conversations)  
- Getting lost in the details of stories  
- Reading body language  
- Distinguishing offensive remarks

## Diagnostic Criteria
1. Persistent difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication in a social context, including:  
  1. Deficits in in-context social communications (e.g., greetings, sharing information)  
  2. Difficulty changing communication style or tactics to match the context (e.g., changing volume when speaking in a quiet library as opposed to a crowded playground, speaking differently with children than adults, avoiding overly formal language)  
  3. Difficulty following normal rules of conversation and storytelling (e.g., taking or following turns in conversation, rephrasing a part of a story, using verbal and nonverbal signs to regulate interaction).  
  4. Difficulty understanding implicit meanings (i.e., making inferences) and non-literal or ambiguous meanings of language (e.g., sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, multiple meanings).  
2. The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication, social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or occupational performance.  
3. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (typically before age 8).  
4. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurological condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and grammar, and not better explained by autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global development delay, or another mental disorder.
