Global Developmental Delay (GDD) is a placeholder diagnosis given to children who miss developmental milestones (e.g., motor, speech and language, cognition, social functioning, daily living activities) but are too young to undergo more specific standardized evaluations, such as IQ testing. Pediatric clinicians try to avoid premature diagnosis as symptoms evolve over a child's early development, and many children catch up in time and do not need a more specific diagnosis.  
Early diagnosis and intervention are extremely important to future outcomes. Standard checkpoints to assess developmental milestones include happen during neonatal testing and Developmental Screening at 9, 18, and 30 months, as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at 18 and 24 months.  

## Diagnostic Criteria
1. The child is under the age of 5 and shows significant delays (i.e., two standard deviations below the mean) in two or more developmental domains, including gross motor skills, fine motor skills, speech and language, social and personal skills, and cognitive abilities.
