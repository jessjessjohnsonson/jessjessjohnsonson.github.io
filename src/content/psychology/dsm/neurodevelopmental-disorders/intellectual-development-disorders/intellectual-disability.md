Intellectual Disability (ID), or Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD), is the slower acquisition or failure to achieve intellectual and adaptive milestones <i>specifically during the developmental period</i> ID is usually caused by genetic factors (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome), prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures or deficiencies (e.g., prenatal alcohol, postnatal lead, prenatal iodine deficiency), and environmental causes (e.g., certain infections, brain injury). However, many cases (~30%) are of unknown cause. 

Signs and symptoms of ID include:
- Delays in reaching, or failure to reach milestones in motor skills development (e.g., sitting, crawling, walking)
- Delays in learning to speak, or continued difficulties with speech and language after starting to talk
- Difficulty with self-care (e.g., getting dressed, washing, feeding)
- Difficulty planning and/or problem-solving
- Behavioral and/or social problems
- Continued infant childlike behavior, failure to grow intellectually
- Difficulty keeping up in school
- Difficulty understanding and/or following social rules   

ID affects about 2-3% of the population, 25% of cases being related to a genetic disorder. The condition is classified as "Mild" (~75-90% of cases), "Moderate" (~10% of cases), "Severe" (~3.5% of cases), or "Profound" (~1.5% of cases) based on the person's ability to learn and perform skills and the level of support they will require, and IQ range is used as an indicator but not definitive diagnostic element. Mild ID often does not present until school age or even the second decade of life, when academic deficiencies become apparent, and does not require extensive support whereas moderate ID is almost always apparent during the first few years of life in the form of motor skill impairments, and severe and profound ID necessitate 24-hour care.

## Relationship to Autism
About 30% of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are also diagnosed with ID. Although the two diagnoses share many characteristics, it is important to distinguish between them to prescribe the best treatment. People with ASD tend to have more trouble with non-verbal social behavior and cues, such as body language, and tend to isolate themselves more and make less eye contact, while people with ID show less repetitive and/or ritualistic behaviors. The top differentiating subsets have been found to be:
- Impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity
- Restricted interests
- Strict adherence to routines
- Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms
- Preoccupation with parts of objects.  

## Relationship to Epilepsy
About 22% of people with ID have epilepsy, which is associated with the severity level of the ID such that about 50% of people with profound ID experience epilepsy. 

# Diagnostic Criteria
1. Deficits in intellectual functioning (i.e., reasoning, planning, problem solving, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience) confirmed by clinical evaluation and IQ testing.  
2. Deficits in adaptive (real life) functioning (e.g., understanding rules, navigating daily living tasks, participating in family, school, and community activities) that significantly hamper the child's ability to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for the independence and social responsibility.  
3. The onset of these criteria in during childhood.  

Note that cognitive and verbal limitations can make psychiatric diagnoses difficult. Onset during the developmental period is necessary to distinguish ID from other neurocognitive conditions such as traumatic brain injuries and dementias.

## Testing and Evaluation
- The standard assessment for ID is the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS), which is based on how much support an individual will need.
- The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales is just one example of a number of assessments for adaptive functioning.
- Prenatal and perinatal medical histories  
- Physical examination  
- Genetic evaluation  
- Metabolic screening  
- Neuroimaging  
- IQ testing  
- Life skills testing 

# Treatment
Treatment for ID typically focuses on early behavioral and cognitive interventions, special education, habilitation, and psychosocial support, as well as targeted treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders and any known underlying physical causes.
