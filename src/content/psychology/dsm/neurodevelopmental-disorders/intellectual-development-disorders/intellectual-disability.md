title: Intellectual Disability
description: Deficits in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior that begin during the developmental period.
prevalence: 1-3%
acronyms: ID, IDD
synonyms: Intellectual Developmental Disorder
---
ID affects about 2-3% of the population, 25% of cases being related to a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome). Other common causes are prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal exposures or deficiencies (e.g., prenatal alcohol, postnatal lead, prenatal iodine deficiency), and environmental causes (e.g., certain infections, brain injury). However, many cases (~30%) are of unknown cause.   

Signs and symptoms of ID include:
- Delays in reaching, or failure to reach milestones in motor skills development (e.g., sitting, crawling, walking)
- Delays in learning to speak, or continued difficulties with speech and language after starting to talk
- Difficulty with self-care (e.g., getting dressed, washing, feeding)
- Difficulty planning and/or problem-solving
- Behavioral and/or social problems
- Continued infant childlike behavior, failure to grow intellectually
- Difficulty keeping up in school
- Difficulty understanding and/or following social rules   

## Diagnostic Criteria
1. Deficits in intellectual functioning (i.e., reasoning, planning, problem solving, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience) confirmed by clinical evaluation and IQ testing.  
2. Deficits in adaptive (real life) functioning (e.g., understanding rules, navigating daily living tasks, participating in family, school, and community activities) that significantly hamper the child's ability to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for the independence and social responsibility.  
3. The onset of symptoms is in the early developmental period (typically before age 8).   

### Specifiers
- Severity:  
    - Mild (~75-90% of cases) — Often does not present until school age or even the second decade of life, when academic deficiencies become apparent, and does not require extensive support.  
    - Moderate (~10% of cases) — Almost always apparent during the first few years of life in the form of motor skill impairments.   
    - Severe (~3.5% of cases) — Requires support with all daily living tasks. They may participate in simple work tasks with support.    
    - Profound (~1.5% of cases) — Require 24-hour care. They may participate in some activities but typically have co-occurring sensorimotor impairments that limit functioning.

## Relationship to Autism
About 30% of people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are also diagnosed with ID. Although the two diagnoses share many characteristics, it is important to distinguish between them to prescribe the best treatment. People with ASD tend to have more trouble with non-verbal social behavior and cues, such as body language, and tend to isolate themselves more and make less eye contact, while people with ID show less repetitive and/or ritualistic behaviors. The top differentiating subsets have been found to be:
- Impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity
- Restricted interests
- Strict adherence to routines
- Stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms
- Preoccupation with parts of objects.  

## Relationship to Epilepsy
About 22% of people with ID have epilepsy, which is associated with the severity level of the ID such that about 50% of people with profound ID experience epilepsy.
