Unspecified Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) is the diagnosis given to individuals who present strong evidence of ID, but cannot be completely assessed due:  
- Severe behavioral problems that interfere with testing  
- Severe sensory or motor impairments  
- Severe language barriers  
- Medical instability  

Similar to GDD, this diagnosis allows clinicians to avoid inaccurate or inappropriate diagnoses without sufficient information.
