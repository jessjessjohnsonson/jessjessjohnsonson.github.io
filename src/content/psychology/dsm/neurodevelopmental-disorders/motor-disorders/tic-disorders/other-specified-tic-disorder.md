The OSTD diagnosis is given when tic symptoms are present but the symptoms do not fit a more specific diagnosis <i>and</i> the clinician is able to specify the reason why. These reasons include:  
- Onset is after age 18  
- Tics last less than 4 weeks  
- Tics can be attributed to another medical condition, such as brain injury or medication  
- Atypical tic presentations, i.e., tics do not fit typical motor or vocal patterns. Some examples include:  
    - Complex behavioral sequences that blur the line between tics and compulsions, like arranging objects in specific patterns.  
    - Sensory urges or phantom sensations, such as persistent feelings of something crawling on the skin, internal "electrical" sensations, or an overwhelming urge to experience certain tactile sensations.  
    - Blocking tics in which motor activity or speech is briefly interrupted by pauses.  
    - Respiratory tics involving complex breathing patterns, breath-holding, or hyperventilation.  
    - Tics with unusual triggers like specific environmental stimuli or emotional states rather than following the typical waxing and waning pattern of most tic disorders.
