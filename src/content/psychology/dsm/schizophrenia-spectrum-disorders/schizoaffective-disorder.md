Schizoaffective Disorder is the condition of concurrent Schizophrenia and Mood Disorder symptoms, and distinguishes patients as neither (a) Schizophrenic with mood symptoms, nor (b) having a mood disorder with psychotic features.

## Diagnostic Criteria
1. <i>Schizophrenia Symptoms + Major Mood Episode</i> — A period of continuous presence of Schizophrenia Criterion A symptoms during which there is either a major depressive episode, a manic episode, or a mixed mood episode.
2. <i>Psychotic-only Period</i> — During the same period of illness, there have been delusions or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms.  
3. <i>Mood Symptom Prominence</i> — Symptoms that meet criteria for a mood episode are present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.  
4. Symptoms cannot be attributed to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.

### Specifiers
- Bipolar type (manic or mixed episodes present)  
- Depressive type (only major depressive episodes present)  
- With catatonia  
- Severity of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and negative symptoms:  
    - 0 — Absent 
    - 1 — Equivocal (e.g., odd or unusual beliefs that are not held with full conviction, fleeting or vague hallucinatory perceptual experiences that are not fully formed or distressing, occasional difficulty staying on topic or a slight loosening of associations, occasional or subtle unusual movements or mannerisms that are not overly bizarre or disruptive)  
    - 2 — Mild (e.g., fixed, false beliefs but not highly elaborate, infrequent, non-distressing hallucinations, speech is sometimes difficult to follow due to derailment or incoherence, brief catatonic features, noticeable decrease in facial expressivity or vocal prosody, reduced motivation or social withdrawal while maintaining basic care)  
    - 3 — Moderate (clear, well-formed delusions that influence their behavior, frequent, distressing hallucinations that influence their behavior, often difficult to follow due to significant derailment, tangentiality, or incoherence, prominent catatonic features, clear and consistent decrease in emotional expression and marked social withdrawal)  
    - 4 — Severe (e.g., delusions are pervasive, highly elaborate, and significantly dictate their behavior, severe and persistent hallucinations that are highly distressing and profoundly influence their actions, speech is almost impossible to follow, characterized by word salad or mutism, prolongued and extreme catatonic features, complete absense of emotional expression, profound avolition, and severe social isolation)
