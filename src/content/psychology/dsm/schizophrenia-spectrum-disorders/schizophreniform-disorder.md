Schizophreniform Disorder has essentially the same symptom profile as Schizophrenia except that the duration period is shorter (1-6 months as opposed to 6+ months). Many people diagnosed with Schizophreniform Disorder will not progress to chronic Schizophrenia and return to their previous level of functioning, while Schizophrenia typically leads to persistent impairment. Schizophreniform serves as a provisional diagnosis to avoid prematurely labeling a person with a chronic, severe mental illness and helps identify people in the early stages of symptoms who might benefits from  early intervention.

## Diagnostic Criteria
1. Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one must be (a) (b) or (c):  
    1. Delusions  
    2. Hallucinations  
    3. Disorganized speech (e.g., derailment or incoherence)  
    4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior  
    5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolution)  
2. <i>Duration </i> — An episode (including prodromal, active, and residual phases) lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months.  
3. <i> Schizoaffective and Mood Disorder Exclusion </i> — Schizoaffective Disorder and Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features have been ruled out because either (1) no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms; or (2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, their total duration has been brief relative to the duration of the active and residual periods.  
4. <i>Substance/General Medical Condition Exclusion </i> — The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.
