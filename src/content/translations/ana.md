This is my English translation of Ismael Serrano's song "Ana".  

Ana, life is so short  
And there are so many goodbyes  
Full of empty promises  

Ana, what will become of us  
When we fall and others take our place?  

Ana, where will the next battle be  
In which we lose the war against loneliness  

Ana, you will hear again  
The stones that happiness threw at your window  

Ana, life is so short  
Maybe I'll become a lie  
And won't know you tomorrow  

Ana, when I withhold a hug from you  
Remember then the year that we forged peace  

Ana, maybe I'll leave and never come back  
Maybe I'll die and you'll never have to curse me again  

Ana, I see you and declare with guilt  
That I want your presence more than I want peace  

Ana, what do I do with my songs?  
With a bundle of frost  
With my desire to kill?  

Ana, what do I do with the mountains  
Of papers that I've signed  
Swearing to die or love  

Swearing to die or love  

Ana
