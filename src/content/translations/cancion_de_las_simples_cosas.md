This is my English translation of César Isella's song "Song of the Simple Things".  

One bids farewell, insensibly, to the little things  
Like a tree in autumn that loses its leaves  

In the end, it's sadness that is the slow death to the little things  
Those simple things that go on aching in the heart  

One always returns to those old places where he loved life  
And then he understands how absent are the dear things  

For that, my girl, don't go now, dreaming of the return  
For love is simple, and the simple things, time devours  

Stay here a little longer, in the bright light of midday  
Where you'll find the table set, with the bread in the sun  

For that, my girl, don't go now, dreaming of the return  
For love is simple, and the simple things, time devours  

One always returns to those old places where he loved life
