This is my English translation of Chabuca Granda's song "That Plowing In the Sea".  

When I forget, I will have forgotten  
I will live as if sleepwalking, free  
I will not long for an answer because I won't have asked  
I won't have forgiven, nor offended  

I will miss the rumination of my dreams  
And the sweet grinding, the hope  
That constant making of someone out of something  
That yearning for castles in the sky  

That plow in the sea of daydreams  
That eternal dreaming...  
Of adolescence
