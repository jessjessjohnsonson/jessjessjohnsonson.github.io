This is my English translation of Violeta Parra's song "Thanks to Life".

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me two stars for eyes  
That perfectly distinguish the black from the white  
In the vaulted sky, its starry backdrop  
And in the crowds, the man that I love  

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me hearing  
That, in all its breadth  
Records the days and the nights  
Crickets and canaries  
Hammers, turbines, barking dogs and rain showers  

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me sound and letters  
With them I build the words  
That I think and declare  
Mother, friend, brother, and luminous light  
The path of the soul that I am loving  

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me the step  
Of my tired feet  
With them I walked over cities and puddles  
Beaches, deserts, mountains and plains  
And your house, your street, your patio  

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me a heart  
That shakes its frame  
When I see the fruit of the human brain  
When I see the good so far from the bad  
When I look into the depths of your clear eyes  

Thanks to life that has given me so much  
It gave me laughter and it gave me tears  
Thus, I discern joy from sorrow  
The two materials that make my song  
And all of your song that is the same song  
And everyone's song that is my own song  

Thanks to life
