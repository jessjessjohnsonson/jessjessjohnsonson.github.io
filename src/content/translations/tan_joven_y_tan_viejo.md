My English translation of Joaqu√≠n Sabina's song "So Young and So Old".  

The first thing I wanted was to get far away  
We, the kids that hated mirrors  
Glued Rita Hayworth's gloves and the streets of New York on the sticker album of resignation  
I hardly saw that life was winking her eye at me  
I asked that at her whim, she dispose of me  
She gave me the keys to the forbidden city  
All that I have, which is nothing, I gave to her  
And like that I grew up flying  

And flew so fast my own shadow lost sight of me  
I ruined my shirt to erase my footprints  
I confused the neon lights for stars  
I cheated at poker  
I defrauded my friends  
On a bench in the park  
I slept like a log  

For saying what I think without thinking about what I say  
They gave me more than a kiss, more than a slap  
What I know about forgetting I learned from the moon  
What I know about sin I had to look for myself  
Like a thief under some girl's skirt whose name I don't like to remember  
So for now, no goodbyes guys  
I fall asleep at the funerals of my generation  
Each night I reinvent myself  
I still get drunk  
So young and so old  
Like a rolling stone
