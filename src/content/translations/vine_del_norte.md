This is my English translation of Ismael Serrano's song "I Came from the North".  

I came from the north looking for a song and a cross  
There crossed a comet, and in its wake was you  
In Madrid it would keep on raining, sad like I left it  
And in Santiago with its lights, its November burned me  

It was after a concert, one night at your college  
There I met you once again  
"Come party with me tonight"  
"I accept your offer gladly, only on one condition:  
That this night doesn't end, and that I don't fall in love."  

On our way to the Alameda, you start to tell me of causes, chances, and struggles  
In those days and in the past  
In front of the Moneda, you hummed Jara  
You looked at me, "Standing like that, so strong, you have an air of Guevara about you"  

We went into a bar and someone was singing Fito  
"At this rate I'm going to fall in love, I just need another pisco"  
"Stop telling stories, come up here and sing me one of Silvio's songs"  
"Only if you give me a kiss" and everybody sang along with me  

We left the bar drunk, holding hands  
And in the street, as always, the cops were fucking around  
You shouted at them, "Murderers!" and we both started to run  
You were laughing and in your laugh I saw myself fall  

"Where have you been all this time?"  
"It's late, go home"  
And in your embrace I thought I heard the Parras singing for us from afar  
"I'd better go"  
I stayed right there, without you, shouting  
"I'll remember you, Amanda"  
"I'll remember you, Amanda"  

In time, I arrived back at my north  
With a song and a cross, with the wake of a comet, with your lie and your light  
In Madrid, it kept on raining just how I'd left it  
And in Santiago there are so many thingsâ€¦ I'm dying to go back today
