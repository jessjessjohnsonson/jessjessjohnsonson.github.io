This is my English translation of Violeta Parra's song "Back to seventeen" or "To be seventeen again". I love the original from Parra's album Las Ãšltimas Composiciones as well as a cover done by Camila Gallardo.  

To go back to seventeen after living a century  
Is like deciphering symbols without being a fit sage  
Suddenly being so fragile again, like a second  
Feeling so deeply again, like a child in front of God  
That is how I feel in this fertile moment  

And so it goes, twisting, tangling like ivy on the wall  
Sprouting, growing like moss on the stone  

I step backward as you step forth  
The rainbow of our alliance has penetrated my nest  
With all its colors it has passed through my veins  
And even the strong chain with which destiny has tied us  
Is like a fine diamond that illuminates my tranquil soul  

What feeling can do, knowing could not  
Nor the clearest process, nor the broadest thought  
Everything changes in a moment  
Like a condescending magician that gently pulls us away from grudges and violence  
Only love with its science brings us back our innocence  

And so it goes, twisting, tangling like ivy on the wall  
Sprouting, growing like moss on the stone  

Love is a whirlwind of original purity  
Even to the ferocious animal she whispers her sweet trill  
She halts the pilgrims, frees the prisoners  
Love, with its care, turns the old man into a boy  
Only loving makes evil pure and sincere again  

The window flew wide open, as if by magic  
Love entered in her cloak like a warm morning  
At the sound of her beautiful song the jasmine started to bloom  
Flying like a Seraphim, she placed jewels in the sky  
And to my seventeenth birthday, the angel returned me  

And so it goes, twisting, tangling like ivy on the wall  
Sprouting, growing like moss on the stone
